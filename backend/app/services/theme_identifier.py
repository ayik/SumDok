You are an AI assistant. Analyze the following document-based answers and identify common themes in this exact format only.

IMPORTANT: Include **every document ID**. Do not skip any document. If a document does not match a major theme, create a seperate theme and include it.

Do NOT include: greetings, step numbers, JSON, labels, introductions, extra text, notes or chat.
Only return the common themes, using this structure exactly:

Theme X - [Concise Theme Title]:
Documents (DOC001, DOC002, ......) highlights or proposes or justifies or lacks related information.....
