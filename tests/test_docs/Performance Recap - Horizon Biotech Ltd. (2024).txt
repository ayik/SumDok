Horizon Biotech Ltd. recorded a notable 14% increase in revenues in 2024, closing the year at $2.3 billion. The company's main revenue driver was its flagship oncology drug, which saw expanded adoption in international markets. Licensing agreements and regional partnerships further enhanced the global footprint.

Horizon reported a gross margin of 60%, an improvement over last year's 57%, attributed to manufacturing cost efficiencies and higher-margin product sales. The company invested in automation across its key facilities to streamline production workflows.

R&D expenditures reached $480 million, reflecting the company's pipeline of 12 active clinical trials. The firm prioritized research into gene therapies and rare diseases, areas it believes will define its future growth.

Net profit reached $390 million, translating to an EPS of $3.20. The board proposed a dividend of $0.45 per share and announced a $100 million stock buyback program for 2025.

Employee engagement rose significantly, driven by performance-linked bonuses and a new hybrid work model. Surveys showed a 93% satisfaction rate, with particularly high scores in work-life balance and leadership transparency.

The company launched a digital therapeutics division, aimed at integrating software into treatment plans for chronic illnesses. This strategic move has positioned Horizon as a pioneer in hybrid biotech-digital solutions.

Supply chain resiliency was strengthened through multi-continent redundancy planning and regional warehousing. This ensured consistent product availability during global logistics disruptions.

A new leadership development program was introduced for middle management, with the goal of nurturing internal talent for senior roles. The first cohort graduated in Q4, and 30% have already taken on expanded responsibilities.

Horizon enhanced its investor communication strategy with more detailed quarterly disclosures and virtual town halls. Feedback from shareholders indicated improved transparency and trust.

Plans for 2025 include opening a new research center in Switzerland dedicated to mRNA-based treatments. Construction has already begun, and the facility is expected to be operational by Q3.
